Q-1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A-1. To interpret the user's needs, start your research by conducting interviews, surveys, and observations to understand your user's goals, challenges, and preferences. In order to implement the User Needs, you will need to define requirements by translating the user needs into functional and non-functional requirements for the program. Then you can then assess which features address the most pressing user needs and prioritize them based on impact and feasibility. Finally you will use Agile methodologies to build, test, and refine the program iteratively, incorporating user feedback at each stage.

User stories are brief, simple descriptions of features told from the perspective of the user. They follow a format like: “As a (user), I want (goal) so that (reason)”. User Stories keep the focus on the user's needs and goals, ensuring that development aligns with real-world usage. They help in prioritizing features based on user value, making it easier to decide what to work on first. User stories can include acceptance criteria, which define what needs to be done for the story to be considered complete, guiding development and testing. User Stories can also evolve based on feedback, allowing you to adapt to changing user needs throughout the development process. By effectively interpreting user needs and using user stories, you can create a program that truly resonates with its users and meets their expectations.

Q-2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

A-2. When I develope programs, I start by trying to understand the purpose of the program (What problem does it solve? Who are the users? etc.). Then I start my research and planning, gather my requirements, then create user stories to capture the user's needs. Next I would decide what programming language to use (Python, Java, C++). Agile is great becuase it provides the tools to be organized while also allowing for flexibility and adaptability. Some of the Agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work would include the Scrum practices, Kanban boards, Retrospectives, User Stories and Backlogs.

Q-3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A-3. I think that a good team member requires being open-minded and adaptable. Your team will be comprised of many different personalities, and they will all have different opinions, so it's important to remember that everyone on the team has the same goal. That goal is to deliver a product. Agile promotes itself as being a highly adaptable process and so the developers have to be adaptable as well. Team members have to be open to ideas outside of their own and be able to acknowledge differences of opinion. This helps develope a sense of trust and camaraderie in the team.
