Q1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A1. Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is a crucial part of software development. To interpret the user's needs, start your research by conducting interviews, surveys, and observations to understand your user's goals, challenges, and preferences. In order to implement the User Needs, you will need to define requirements by translating the user needs into functional and non-functional requirements for the program. Then you can then assess which features address the most pressing user needs and prioritize them based on impact and feasibility. Finally you will use Agile methodologies to build, test, and refine the program iteratively, incorporating user feedback at each stage.

User stories are brief, simple descriptions of features told from the perspective of the user. They follow a format like: “As a (user), I want (goal) so that (reason)”. User Stories keep the focus on the user's needs and goals, ensuring that development aligns with real-world usage. They help in prioritizing features based on user value, making it easier to decide what to work on first. User stories can include acceptance criteria, which define what needs to be done for the story to be considered complete, guiding development and testing. User Stories can also evolve based on feedback, allowing you to adapt to changing user needs throughout the development process. By effectively interpreting user needs and using user stories, you can create a program that truly resonates with its users and meets their expectations.
